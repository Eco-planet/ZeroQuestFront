        Please pay attention to the endangered animal, the red panda.

      <p class="mb-10 font-medium text-xl">
        The number of red pandas is gradually decreasing.<br>
        Although there is a lack of ecological survey data <br>
        on habitat and population, <br>
        The reason for the low population <br>
        is habitat destruction due to development,<br>
        Poaching for leather or pets is an important cause.<br>
        In addition, red pandas do not like raising children, <br>
        so the number of individuals <br>
        It is said that the reason is that it does not increase well.

      <p class="mb-10 font-medium text-xl">
        In China, India, Nepal, Bhutan, northern Myanmar, etc. <br>
        There are only a small number of them,<br>
        The total population is estimated to be approximately 5,000.<br>
        Of these, approximately 800 are being raised in zoos,<br>
        In particular, Japan is involved <br>
        in the breeding and breeding of red pandas. <br>
        Since its success, we have about 200 of them.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-10 font-medium text-xl">
        The red panda has no related species, <br>
        so if it gets close to extinction, <br>
        Recovery is said to be hopeless.
